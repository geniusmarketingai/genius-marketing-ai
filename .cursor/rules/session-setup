# âœ… Session Setup â€“ Genius Marketing AI (Cursor Agent)

## ðŸ“Ž Load Required Docs into Context

> Please attach and activate the following documents for full architectural and rule awareness:

- `arquitetura-vibecoding.md`
- `regras-vibecoding.md`
- `local-rules-genius-marketing-ai.mdc`
- `progress_log.md`

Once attached, confirm that all are loaded.

## ðŸ§  Activate Required MCPs

@MCP(server-sequential-thinking, context7)

> These MCPs must remain active throughout the entire session:
- `server-sequential-thinking`: for structuring all reasoning in explicit steps.
- `context7`: for consulting external libraries or documentation when needed.

## ðŸ”’ Behavior Enforcement Rules

- Do **not** make architectural decisions without using `server-sequential-thinking`.
- Always update `progress_log.md` with every decision or code change.
- Use `context7` for every library, API, or framework reference.
- Avoid generic responses â€” respond with step-by-step breakdowns only.

Please confirm this setup is complete before proceeding.
